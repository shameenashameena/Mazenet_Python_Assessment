Exercise 1: Prime Number Check

This program checks if a given number is prime or not.
It takes an integer input and verifies if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
If no divisors are found, it prints True, else False.
This helps understand loops, conditions, and number checking in Python.

Exercise 2: Filter Even Numbers

This program takes a list of integers and finds the even numbers.
It creates a new list containing only the even numbers.
The even numbers are sorted in descending order.
This helps understand loops, lists, and basic filtering in Python.

Exercise 3: Unique Sorted List from Strings

This program starts with a list of strings.
It converts the list to a tuple and then to a set to remove duplicates.
The unique elements are converted back to a list and sorted alphabetically.
This helps understand data type conversion, sets, and sorting in Python.

Exercise 4: Count Vowels in Words

This program takes a list of words and counts vowels in each word.
It creates a dictionary with words as keys and vowel counts as values.
It uses dictionary comprehension to create the dictionary efficiently.
This helps understand strings, loops, conditionals, and dictionary operations in Python.

Exercise 5: NumPy Matrix and Diagonal Sum

This program creates a 5×5 matrix using NumPy with values from 1 to 25.
It extracts the diagonal elements from the matrix.
It calculates the sum of the diagonal elements.
This helps understand NumPy arrays, indexing, and basic matrix operations.

Exercise 6: Pandas Series and Temperature Conversion

This program creates a Pandas Series from a list of Celsius temperatures.
It converts the temperatures to Fahrenheit using a formula.
The converted temperatures are stored in a new Series with the same index.
This helps understand Pandas Series, element-wise operations, and indexing.

Exercise 7: Filter Employees by Salary Percentile

This program creates a DataFrame with employee names, departments, and salaries.
It calculates the 75th percentile of salaries.
Employees earning more than this percentile are filtered and returned.
This helps understand DataFrame operations, filtering, and percentiles in Pandas.

Exercise 8: Sales Aggregation and Bar Chart

This program creates a sales DataFrame with product categories and sales figures.
It calculates total sales per product category using aggregation.
It visualizes the results using a bar chart.
This helps understand grouping, aggregation, and data visualization in Python.

Exercise 9: Classes and Inheritance

This program demonstrates object-oriented programming in Python.
A base class Vehicle is created with make and model attributes.
A subclass Car inherits Vehicle and adds num_doors, with a method to display all attributes.
This helps understand classes, inheritance, and methods in Python.

Exercise 10: Bank Account Class (Encapsulation)

This program demonstrates encapsulation using a BankAccount class.
It has a private balance attribute with deposit, withdrawal, and balance enquiry methods.
The withdrawal method ensures the balance never goes negative.
This helps understand private attributes, methods, and OOP principles in Python.
